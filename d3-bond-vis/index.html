        <p>Throughout the 25 Bond films, 007 has found himself in a variety of vehicles <span style="color:#968148; font-weight:bold">in the air</span>, <span style="color:#848484; font-weight:bold">on land</span> and <span
            style="color:#5584AC; font-weight:bold">at sea</span>. Each vehicle is represented by a circle. The size of the circle represents
          how long Bond spent
          in the vehicle on screen.</p>

        <p><i>M's orders, 007. You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5 with modifications. Now, pay attention please. Windscreen - bulletproof. As are the side and the rear windows. Revolving number plates, naturally. Valid - all countries.</i></p>
        <p>Q - Goldfinger (1964)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The legendary 1964 Aston Martin DB5 appears 22 separate scenes across 8 of the Bond Films. The DB5 appeared in all but one of Daniel Craig's films.</p>

        <h1>Bond <span style="color:#968148;">in the air</span></h1>
        <p>The films feature Bond in 67 different types of aircraft.</p>
        <img src="sean-connery-autogyro.jpg" style="height:225px;">
        <p>The longest scene was in Moonraker (1979), where Roger Moore's Bond follows the villain Hugo Drax into space. The climax of the film features a laser battle on Drax's space station. Moonraker holds the world record for the largest number
          of zero gravity wires in one scene.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>The Aston Martin DB5 became one of the most iconic cars in film history. For <i>Goldfinger</i> (1964) Aston Martin originally did not want their car to appear in the film. The producers had to pay them to use the car. Following the success
          of the film, Aston Martin let them use as many cars as they wanted. For <i>Spectre</i> (2015), the company made 10 DB10s, of which 7 were destroyed during filming, at a total cost of £24 million.</p>

        <h1>Bond <span style="color:#5584AC;">at sea</span></h1>
        <p>In 2013, Elon Musk bought the Lotus Esprit underwater car featured in <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> (1977) for £616,000. </p>
        <img src="lotus.jpg" style="height:225px;">
        <p>The car was thought to be lost since its appearance in the film, but was rediscovered in a storage unit in 1989. The vehicle works as a submarine but not as a car, and reportedly cost over $100,000 to build in the 1970s.</p>
